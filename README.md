# better-random
An instrumental code for me to have a better code to generate random numbers and sequences

## Idea

random.org is NOT ideal random-ish approach to generate number, so when I need some number or sequence, I always increase a level of randomness.

This code aimed to introduce a way how to generate a sequence of numbers which would be random but after many iterations.
